name=OpenQuake Integrated Risk Modelling Toolkit
qgisMinimumVersion=2.14
description=Tools to drive the OpenQuake Engine, to develop composite indicators and integrate them with physical risk estimations, and to predict building recovery times following an earthquake
about=This plugin allows users to drive OpenQuake Engine calculations (https://github.com/gem/oq-engine) of physical hazard and risk, and to load the corresponding outputs as QGIS layers. For those outputs, data visualization tools are provided. The toolkit also enables users to develop composite indicators to measure and quantify social characteristics, and combine them with estimates of human or infrastructure loss. The plugin can interact with the OpenQuake Platform (https://platform.openquake.org), to browse and download socio-economic data or existing projects, edit projects locally in QGIS and upload and share them with the scientific community. A post-earthquake recovery modeling framework is incorporated into the toolkit, to produce building level and/or community level recovery functions.

# Uncomment the following line and add your changelog entries:
changelog=
    2.7.3
    * The Data Viewer is automatically set to visible only when opening oq-engine outputs that require it for their visualization
    2.7.2
    * When loading a OQ-Engine output, if the Data Viewer was hidden, it becomes visible
    * When loading a gmf map, the default name is "scenario_gmfs_rlz-RLZ_eid-EID" both for scenario_risk and scenario_damage
    * Added a check on the status code returned by the oq-engine server 'extract' API, displaying an error message in case of failure
    2.7.1
    * Losses can be aggregated by loss type and multiple tags, producing a table with aggregated values per realization
    2.7.0
    * Added the possibility to visualize oq-engine outputs of types agg_curves-rlzs, agg_curves-stats, dmg_by_asset and losses_by_asset
    * Damage can be aggregated by realization, loss type and multiple tags, producing a bar plot displaying aggregated damages
      for each damage state (with the possibility to include or exclude "no damage" from the chart)
    2.6.1
    * For hazard curves and uniform hazard spectra, it is possible to plot together multiple statistical outputs (e.g. mean and quantiles)
    * Fixed an offset issue with markers
    * The plugin works even if scipy is not installed and it requests to install it only on the attempt of using
      recovery modeling functionalities
    * Added a button to reset the default plugin settings
    * While driving the OQ-Engine, notifications are displayed on top of the widget instead of using the main messageBar
    * The widget driving the OQ-Engine handles also the LocationParseError exception
    * One single widget loads losses_by_asset or dmg_by_asset and aggregates points by polygons taken from a zonal layer
    * When the active layer has an assigned output type, other output types can not be selected in the Data Viewer
    * Fixed an error occurring while switching between a layer that does not use the Data Viewer and one that uses it,
      that was caused by a missing re-initialization in a corner case
    2.6.0
    * The plugin is aligned with OQ-Engine version 2.6
    * Added a warning message in case of connection with a potentially incompatible version of the OQ-Engine Server
    * The list of calculations displays the Calculation Mode instead of the Job Type
    * Loaders for OQ-Engine hazard outputs can read the new format introduced in OQ-Engine version 2.6
    * Layers for hazard curves are stored in a more convenient way, keeping a scalar value per cell instead of a json string
    * Integration tests check that all implemented loaders for OQ-Engine outputs are tested at least once
    * Both workflows aggregating loss points by zone are tested on Travis (1: using SAGA; 2: using the fallback algorithm)
