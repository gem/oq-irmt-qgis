name=OpenQuake Integrated Risk Modelling Toolkit
qgisMinimumVersion=2.4
description=Tools for the development of composite indicators measuring societal characteristics and the integration of these with physical risk estimations
about=Tools for creating and editing indicators and composite indices to measure social characteristics and for combining these with estimates of physical earthquake risk (i.e. estimates of human or infrastructure loss). The plugin enables users to directly interact with the OpenQuake Platform (https://platform.openquake.org), in order to browse and download socioeconomic data or existing projects, to edit projects locally in QGIS, then to upload and share them through the Platform. This plugin was designed as a collaborative effort between the GEM Foundation (http://www.globalquakemodel.org) and the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (http://www.cedim.de/english/), and it has been developed by the GEM Foundation. It was formerly named GEM OpenQuake Social Vulnerability and Integrated Risk (SVIR).
