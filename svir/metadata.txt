name=OpenQuake Integrated Risk Modelling Toolkit
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Tools to drive the OpenQuake Engine, to develop composite indicators and integrate them with physical risk estimations, and to predict building recovery times following an earthquake
about=This plugin allows users to drive OpenQuake Engine calculations (https://github.com/gem/oq-engine) of physical hazard and risk, and to load the corresponding outputs as QGIS layers. For those outputs, data visualization tools are provided. The toolkit also enables users to develop composite indicators to measure and quantify social characteristics, and combine them with estimates of human or infrastructure loss. The plugin can interact with the OpenQuake Platform (https://platform.openquake.org), to browse and download socio-economic data or existing projects, edit projects locally in QGIS and upload and share them with the scientific community. A post-earthquake recovery modeling framework is incorporated into the toolkit, to produce building level and/or community level recovery functions.

changelog=
    3.6.0
    * Changed the realizations output for OQ-Engine scenario calculations, displaying the GSIM names instead of the branch path
    * All possibly running timers are stopped before the plugin is unloaded
    * Fixed a bug occurring while loading ground motion fields, that caused only one realization to be visualized
    * Multi-peril input files containing geometries as WKT can be loaded as layers
    3.5.3
    * The GUI elements for loading OQ-Engine outputs are in a scrollable area, usable also on low resolution screens
    * Some GUI sections can be expanded/collapsed
    3.5.2
    * Fixed a bug in the loader for asset_risk outputs, that was downloading a not used csv output
    3.5.1
    * Higher map values can optionally be rendered on top of lower values
    * The utility to import_layer_from_csv accepts two additional parameters: 'add_to_legend' and 'add_on_top'
    3.5.0
    * Layers imported from the OQ-Engine are inserted on top of the QGIS layer tree
    * Added loaders for OQ-Engine outputs 'asset_risk' and 'agg_risk'
    * The option to aggregate points by polygons is automatically enabled whenever at least one layer containing polygons becomes available
    * Geopackages containing polygons for the aggregation of points by zone can be pre-loaded, selecting the desired layers from the package
    * An additional checkbox gives the possibility to automatically discard zones that contain no points
    * Improved legends and classification criteria, depending on the unique values present in the field used for styling
    * The menu action to aggregate loss by zone was re-added, pointing to the Processing Toolkit algorithm that we use now to perform the 
      same kind of analysis (i.e. "Join attributes by location (summary)"). The section of the user manual that was previously removed is
      partially restored, and there is an explanation on how to use the Processing algorithm to obtain the same results that were obtained
      by the plugin tool before.
    * Fixed removal of plugin menu while the plugin is unloaded/uninstalled/disabled
    * Map units are not set by default anymore
    * Field names are quoted in order to avoid issues with special characters
    * Buttons to load layers that have no geometries are renamed from "Load layer" to "Load table"
    * Upgraded compatibility to the OQ Platform 2019
    * Better management of failing connection with the OQ Engine server
    * Fixed newline separators in csv files exported by the Data Viewer
    3.4.0
    * Whenever an error message is shown to the user, a button in the QGIS message bar allows to display the traceback in a separate window
    * Fixed loader for Aggregate Loss Curves in event based risk OQ-Engine output
    * Tests have been split into: unit tests (using the qgis.testing module); functional tests (running on the official QGIS docker
      without external services); integration tests (running on the official QGIS docker and interacting with a running OQ-Engine
    * When an OQ-Engine output can't be extracted, the error is handled and the full response message is logged
    3.3.0
    * Fixed loader for aggregated Average Asset Losses Statistics OQ-Engine output
    * All calls to the OQ-Engine "extract" API are logged
    * Fixed a bug that caused the log verbosity to be always set to "warning", instead of reading it correctly from user settings 
    3.2.12
    * More stable connection with the OQ-Engine server, preventing issues while reading the console log of a calculation
    3.2.11
    * Added instructions about how to workaround a bug that occurs on macOS while importing matplotlib.pyplot on matplotlib v3.0.0
    * Fixed updating the status of the toolbar button that shows/hides the IRTM Data Viewer
    3.2.10
    * Added the possibility to 'Abort' an OQ-Engine calculation
    3.2.9
    * When saving plugin settings, any dialog driving the oq-engine is reset
    * When the connection with the oq-engine server is lost, the plugin attempts to reconnect 3 times before displaying an error
    * For uniform hazard spectra layers, poe and return_period are saved as customProperties, and they are displayed in UHS plots
    3.2.8
    * Ported to qgis3 the conversion of layer style to the format accepted by Geoserver
    * Fixed a bug loading hazard maps loading one layer per realization or statistic
    3.2.7
    * Updated installation instructions
    3.2.6
    * The loader for hazard maps was updated, fixing compatibility with the OQ-Engine after a change in the output format
    3.2.5
    * Hazard maps can be loaded as one layer per realization/statistic or as multiple layers, per each combination of realization/statistic-imt-poe
    * It is possible to load hazard curves for a selected combination of realization/statistic and intensity measure type
    * Intensity measure levels are casted to float when possible, fixing a plotting issue in hazard curves with IMT=PGV
    * The cursor does not switch to "waiting" while refreshing the OQ-Engine calculation list
    * When feedback is shown outside the dialog that drives the OQ-Engine, a message suggests the user where to look
    3.2.4

    * Layers loaded from OQ-Engine outputs store as custom properties the versions of the OQ-Engine and of the IRMT plugin
    * The dependency from SAGA was removed (aggregation of points by zone is performed by the plugin, internally)
