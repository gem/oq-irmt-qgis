name=OpenQuake Integrated Risk Modelling Toolkit
qgisMinimumVersion=2.4
description=Tools for the development of composite indicators measuring societal characteristics and the integration of these with physical risk estimations
about=Tools for creating and editing indicators and composite indices to measure social characteristics and for combining these with estimates of physical earthquake risk (i.e. estimates of human or infrastructure loss). The plugin enables users to directly interact with the OpenQuake Platform (https://platform.openquake.org), in order to browse and download socioeconomic data or existing projects, to edit projects locally in QGIS, then to upload and share them through the Platform. This plugin was designed as a collaborative effort between the GEM Foundation (http://www.globalquakemodel.org) and the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (http://www.cedim.de/english/), and it has been developed by the GEM Foundation. It was formerly named GEM OpenQuake Social Vulnerability and Integrated Risk (SVIR).

changelog=
    1.8.14
    * New settings dialog to edit recovery modeling parameters (removed config folder)
    * Fixed a casting issue that caused a bug in the calculation of the overal time interval
    1.8.13
    * Many additions to the user manual
    * Messages displayed in the QGIS message bar are also added to the log
    * Fix header of csv for data exported from the Data Viewer
    * Improved visualization and export of uniform hazard spectra
    1.8.12
    * Fields containing damage states probabilities can be selected through a multiselect widget
    1.8.11
    * While calculating recovery curves, a feedback on the progress of the calculation is displayed
    * Changing the number of simulations per building does not cause the tool to immediately
      recalculate the recovery curve. Instead, an additional button can be used to launch the calculation
    * An additional checkbox enables/disables to save recovery curves for individual buildings
    1.8.10
    * Enable using a different number of loss-based damage states
    * When using a custom operator, children nodes will be displayed with equal diameter
    * Minor additions to the manual, describing the new nested menu
    * Do not time out when downloading an output from the OQ-Engine
    1.8.9
    * Allow API endpoints to be used with a self-signed SSL certificate
    1.8.8
    * Fix highlighting points on map when hovering on corresponding curves in plots
    * Fix visualization of multiple curves when switching IMT
    * Fix displaying the number of available event ids when loading ground motion fields from the OQ-Engine
    1.8.7
    * Remove all dependencies from the openquake libraries
    1.8.6
    * Use npz instead of hdf5
    * Fix displaying the output list for oq-engine calculations (properly refreshing)
    * Fix reading `composite_risk_model`, for plotting `dmg_total` and `dmg_by_taxon`
    1.8.5
    * Enable recovery modeling both for the csv output of oq-engine and for its shapefile translation
    1.8.4
    * Enable recalculating composite indices using custom operators
      with the same format used by the field calculator
    * Replace toolbox with a nested menu
    * Enable hdf5-related actions only on Ubuntu
    * While performing recovery modeling, enable changing the number of simulations per building
    * Add bugfixes and features introduced in stable versions of the plugin up to v1.7.16
