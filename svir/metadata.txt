name=OpenQuake Integrated Risk Modelling Toolkit
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Tools to drive the OpenQuake Engine, to develop composite indicators and integrate them with physical risk estimations, and to predict building recovery times following an earthquake
about=This plugin allows users to drive OpenQuake Engine calculations (https://github.com/gem/oq-engine) of physical hazard and risk, and to load the corresponding outputs as QGIS layers. For those outputs, data visualization tools are provided. The toolkit also enables users to develop composite indicators to measure and quantify social characteristics, and combine them with estimates of human or infrastructure loss. The plugin can interact with the OpenQuake Platform (https://platform.openquake.org), to browse and download socio-economic data or existing projects, edit projects locally in QGIS and upload and share them with the scientific community. A post-earthquake recovery modeling framework is incorporated into the toolkit, to produce building level and/or community level recovery functions.

changelog=
    3.7.1
    * Instead of the 'sourcegroups' output (that was removed from the OQ-Engine), the plugin can now load the new output 'events'
    * The user can choose if selecting the '.ini' file to run a OQ-Engine calculation, or letting the OQ-Engine automatically pick one from the list of input files.
    * A note about updating the SSL certificate bundle on MacOS was added to the manual
    3.7.0
    * Loading the OQ-Engine output 'dmg_by_asset', it is possible to aggregate assets by site (as in the previous implementation) or to load the raw data
      as it is compatible with the recovery modeling tool
    * The y-axis of recovery curves is displayed as a percentage instead of a number in the range 0-1
    * The recovery modeling tool calculates the probabilities of being in each damage state as the number of buildings per damage state divided by the total number of buildings (per asset)
    * While selecting assets for recovery modeling, a new checkbox enables/disables recalculating recovery curves on-the-fly
    * Another checkbox enables/disables the selection of all the assets that share the same coordinates, when the user clicks on a feature in the map
    3.6.1
    * Calls to QgsVectorLayer.getFeatures() are optimized, reading only the necessary fields and ignoring geometries if unneeded
    * Multi-peril input files containing geometries as WKT can be loaded as layers
    * Improvements to the integration tests: an instance of Irmt is used instead of instantiating Irmt sub-dialogs, and no mocked object is used anymore;
      OQ-Engine outputs that are loaded as QGIS layers are checked to contain at least one feature; an additional integration test runs a OQ-Engine hazard calculation,
      displays its progress log, then runs a risk calculation based on its outputs, showing again the progress, then deletes both calculations;
      instead of running one single big integration test, a single test is run for each OQ-Engine output type that the IRMT is able to load.
    * When the mouse points to the name of a OQ-Engine output, a tooltip displays the output type code and its approximate size (if available)
    * Fixed a useless downloading of unneeded files while loading OQ-Engine outputs using the "extract" API
    * Fixed the possibility to load data corresponding to specific taxonomies, for dmg_by_asset and losses_by_asset OQ-Engine output types
    3.6.0
    * Changed the realizations output for OQ-Engine scenario calculations, displaying the GSIM names instead of the branch path
    * The plugin is also a Processing Toolbox algorithm provider, offering an extensible set of field transformation functions
      (normalization/standardization, ranking, and others) and a modified version of the "Join attributes by location (summary)"
      algorithm, that automatically styles the output joined layer
    * Re-added and updated the user manual chapter about aggregating points by zone
    * Scripts running tests and building the user manual have been fixed
    * All possibly running timers are stopped before the plugin is unloaded
    * Fixed a bug occurring while loading ground motion fields, that caused only one realization to be visualized
    3.5.3
    * The GUI elements for loading OQ-Engine outputs are in a scrollable area, usable also on low resolution screens
    * Some GUI sections can be expanded/collapsed
    3.5.2
    * Fixed a bug in the loader for asset_risk outputs, that was downloading a not used csv output
    3.5.1
    * Higher map values can optionally be rendered on top of lower values
    * The utility to import_layer_from_csv accepts two additional parameters: 'add_to_legend' and 'add_on_top'
    3.5.0
    * Layers imported from the OQ-Engine are inserted on top of the QGIS layer tree
    * Added loaders for OQ-Engine outputs 'asset_risk' and 'agg_risk'
    * The option to aggregate points by polygons is automatically enabled whenever at least one layer containing polygons becomes available
    * Geopackages containing polygons for the aggregation of points by zone can be pre-loaded, selecting the desired layers from the package
    * An additional checkbox gives the possibility to automatically discard zones that contain no points
    * Improved legends and classification criteria, depending on the unique values present in the field used for styling
    * The menu action to aggregate loss by zone was re-added, pointing to the Processing Toolkit algorithm that we use now to perform the 
      same kind of analysis (i.e. "Join attributes by location (summary)"). The section of the user manual that was previously removed is
      partially restored, and there is an explanation on how to use the Processing algorithm to obtain the same results that were obtained
      by the plugin tool before.
    * Fixed removal of plugin menu while the plugin is unloaded/uninstalled/disabled
    * Map units are not set by default anymore
    * Field names are quoted in order to avoid issues with special characters
    * Buttons to load layers that have no geometries are renamed from "Load layer" to "Load table"

      without external services); integration tests (running on the official QGIS docker and interacting with a running OQ-Engine
    * When an OQ-Engine output can't be extracted, the error is handled and the full response message is logged
    3.3.0

    * It is possible to load hazard curves for a selected combination of realization/statistic and intensity measure type
    * Intensity measure levels are casted to float when possible, fixing a plotting issue in hazard curves with IMT=PGV
    * The cursor does not switch to "waiting" while refreshing the OQ-Engine calculation list
    * When feedback is shown outside the dialog that drives the OQ-Engine, a message suggests the user where to look
