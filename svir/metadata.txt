name=OpenQuake Integrated Risk Modelling Toolkit
qgisMinimumVersion=2.14
description=Tools to drive the OpenQuake Engine, to develop composite indicators and integrate them with physical risk estimations, and to predict building recovery times following an earthquake
about=This plugin allows users to drive OpenQuake Engine calculations (https://github.com/gem/oq-engine) of physical hazard and risk, and to load the corresponding outputs as QGIS layers. For those outputs, data visualization tools are provided. The toolkit also enables users to develop composite indicators to measure and quantify social characteristics, and combine them with estimates of human or infrastructure loss. The plugin can interact with the OpenQuake Platform (https://platform.openquake.org), to browse and download socio-economic data or existing projects, edit projects locally in QGIS and upload and share them with the scientific community. A post-earthquake recovery modeling framework is incorporated into the toolkit, to produce building level and/or community level recovery functions.

changelog=
    3.1.0
    * Ruptures imported from the OQ-Engine can be styled automatically by tectonic region type or by magnitude
    * Improved visualization of aggregate outputs in the Data Viewer
    3.0.2
    * Fixed styling of scenario damage after aggregating damage by zone
    * Fixed selection/deselection of tag values in aggregate losses/damages visualization in the Data Viewer
    3.0.1
    * After aggregating loss/damage by zone, the layer containing points is made invisible
    3.0.0
    * Added loaders for realizations and sourcegroups, from csv
    * Added the loader for Average Asset Losses Statistics and the visualization of aggregated values in the Data Viewer
    * Default styles for layers imported from OQ-Engine outputs depend on the output type
    * When importing damages or losses from the OQ-Engine and aggregating them by zone, only sums are added to the zonal layer,
      and the zonal layer is automatically styled, classifying with respect to the sum of losses/damage
    * Fixed a bug that prevented from loading existing projects from the OpenQuake Platform
    * It is possible to check the connection with the OQ-Platform or with the OQ-Engine from within the plugin settings dialog
    * The visualization of OQ-Engine risk outputs is now described in the user manual
    2.10.0
    * Dialogs embedding OpenQuake web applications (IPT and TaxtWEB) display a progress bar while loading a new page, and there
      is an additional button to reload the homepage. If a page can not be loaded, an error message is displayed.
    * The GUI provides clearer error messages in case the plugin is unable to connect with the OQ Engine WebUI
    2.9.6
    * When loading hazard maps from OQ-Engine, values for all intensity measure types and probabilities of exceedance can be stored
      in a single layer.
    * Layers built from OQ-Engine outputs have the custom property 'calc_id' storing the id of the corresponding OQ-Engine calculation.
    * The names of files exported by the Data Viewer contain the id of the corresponding OQ-Engine calculation.
    2.9.5
    * Several updates to the user manual
    * Fixed bug in the GUI initialization for visualizing aggregate loss curves
    2.9.4
    * Fixed retrieval of the engine server hostname from settings
    2.9.3
    * Hazard maps, hazard curves and uniform hazard spectra are loaded through the "extract" API offered by the OQ Engine Server,
      instead of using the exported npz
    * Fixed the visualization of UHS in case PGA is not present
    * Multiple connection profiles can be saved, making it easier to switch between different OQ-Engine servers and OQ Platforms.
    * It is possible to modify the log verbosity of the plugin, through a new property in the plugin settings
    2.9.2
    * If a selected OQ-Engine calculation is running, the corresponding outputs will be listed as soon as the calculation is complete.
    * Fixed the button showing parameters of a OQ-Engine calculation
    2.9.1
    * Fixed a bug that made impossible to visualize the dialog that drives the OpenQuake Engine
    * Fixed issues importing Qt on macOS
    2.9.0
    * The plugin embeds 3 standalone OpenQuake applications: Input Preparation Toolkit, TaxtWEB and Taxonomy Glossary
    * When a OQ-Engine calculation is removed, the corresponding buttons and its list of outputs are properly cleared.
    * An additional checkbox in the settings enables/disables experimental features
    * Recovery modeling functionalities and the embedded standalone OpenQuake applications are enabled only if experimental
      features are enabled from the plugin settings.
    2.8.1
    * When interacting with the OQ-Engine or the OQ-Platform, the plugin will attempt first to use the default credentials.
      It will open the settings dialog automatically, in case the login fails with the default settings.
    * When a problem causes the widget that drives the OQ-Engine to be closed, error messages are displayed in the general
      QGIS message bar, instead of using the inner message bar of the widget (otherwise, they would not be visible to the user)
    * Fix a bug in the check of layer capabilities, that was working only with QGIS locale set to English
    2.8.0
    * In aggregated loss curves, it is possible to display a chosen set of realizations or statistics (mean, quantiles, etc.)
