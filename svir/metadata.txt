name=OpenQuake Integrated Risk Modelling Toolkit
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Tools to drive the OpenQuake Engine, to develop composite indicators and integrate them with physical risk estimations, and to predict building recovery times following an earthquake
about=This plugin allows users to drive OpenQuake Engine calculations (https://github.com/gem/oq-engine) of physical hazard and risk, and to load the corresponding outputs as QGIS layers. For those outputs, data visualization tools are provided. The toolkit also enables users to develop composite indicators to measure and quantify social characteristics, and combine them with estimates of human or infrastructure loss. The plugin can interact with the OpenQuake Platform (https://platform.openquake.org), to browse and download socio-economic data or existing projects, edit projects locally in QGIS and upload and share them with the scientific community. A post-earthquake recovery modeling framework is incorporated into the toolkit, to produce building level and/or community level recovery functions.

changelog=
    3.16.3
    * Following the migration to c++ of the processing algorithm qgis:joinbylocationsummary, the plugin uses the new version
      and applies styling separately instead of running it within a postprocessing phase of an inherited algorithm
    3.16.2
    * The extent of layers having at least one feature but empty extent is increased by a small delta in order to allow zooming to layer
    3.16.1
    * The button to retrieve the OQ Engine calculation parameters is properly reset similarly to what was already correctly done for the button to download the datastore
    3.16.0
    * Aligned with OQ-Engine 3.16
    3.15.3
    * When exporting data from the Data Viewer, selected tags (if present) are correctly reported in the output csv
    * When loading a csv as layer, the user is asked to confirm in case the csv is bigger than 10 MB
    * For 'Asset Risk Distributions', also a table of consequences is shown if available
    * The visualization of 'aggcurves' and 'aggcurves-stats' was updated according to changes in the OQ-Engine extract API
    * The 'Load table' button was added also for OQ-Engine outputs 'damages-stats' and 'aggrisk-stats'
    * The 'Load layer' and 'Aggregate' buttons for avg_losses-rlzs are not available in case 'avg_losses-stats' is present (because in that case the OQ-Engine only extract statistics and not all the separate realizations)
    3.15.2
    * The user manual is built via docker and the makefile was improved to retrieve plugin version and experimental tag from metadata and update the online documentation accordingly
    3.15.1
    * Accepting also taxonomies that include the character '='
    3.15.0
    * Aligned with oq-engine 3.15
    3.14.2
    * Ground motion fields are read identifying site coordinates through field names instead of positionally, making it robust to the addition of fields such as 'custom_site_id'
    * A clearer error message is given if Pillow is missing when loading the plugin
    * If any hazard curve is flat with all zeros values, a warning is displayed and the curve is excluded from the plot. If no hazard curve can be plotted, the plot is reset.
    3.14.1
    * Fix styling maps, following an undocumented recent change in QGIS API renaming 'PrettyBreaks' -> 'Pretty'
    3.14.0
    * Installation instructions in the README were updated to be consistent with the user manual
    3.13.1
    * Improved plugin packaging procedure

    * Integration tests for recovery modeling were unskipped
    * The loader for earthquake ruptures was fixed
    * Disaggregation outputs are extracted in separate QgsTask instances, avoiding QGIS to be blocked meanwhile
    * Completely restructured integration tests (IRMT <-> OQ-Engine) and running CI versus qgis dockers 3_8_3, 3_16 and latest
    3.11.2
    * Fixed a bug in the assignment of field types while loading the OQ-Engine Asset Damage Distribution output as layer
    3.11.1
    * Like 3.11.0, but without the "experimental" flag
    3.11.0
    * The OQ-Engine output 'losses_by_event' was renamed into 'agg_loss_table'
    * Fixed displaying full vertical headers in Data Viewer
    * The settings dialog was made scrollable
    * Hazard maps are grouped by POE
    * Following a change in the OQ-Engine, agglosses are now loaded as aggrisk
    * A parameter was added to switch between default hmaps styling and the styling used for SGC projects
    * Cross symbols rendered for OQ-Engine disaggregation outputs are opaque, wider and thicker than those used for other outputs (e.g. hcurves)
    * Following a change in the OQ Engine outputs, avg_damages-rlzs and avg_damages-stats were renamed into damages-rlzs and damages-stats
    * Fixed management of MultiPoint when selecting a point and redrawing charts accordingly
    3.10.0
    * When loading ground motion fields, download and preselect relevant event ids
    * Added possibility to load all hmaps into a single layer, with a style per field created automatically
    * When hmaps are loaded from OQ-Engine outputs and the option to create one layer per statistic is checked, a style per field is created
    * Added loader for disaggregation OQ-Engine outputs
    * The visualization of dmg_by_event and losses_by_event is enabled also for event-based calculations
    * OQ Engine outputs dmg_by_asset and losses_by_asset were renamed (following the change in the engine) to avg_damages-rlzs and avg_losses-rlzs.
    3.9.1
    * For scenario OQ-Engine calculations, when loading GMFs, ranges of event ids per GMPE are displayed while the user chooses an event
    * For GMF loaded layers, the correct GMPE is loaded and the layer name contains the calculation mode and the name of the right GMPE
    * Fixed conversion of numpy data loaded from OQ Engine outputs into native python data types used in QGIS layers
    * Fixed the wrong creation of additional empty fields while loading ground motion fields
    * When pressing the button to run an OQ-Engine calculation or to continue from a previous one, the user can choose if selecting files from a zip file or from
      a directory. In the latter case, also data available in nested directories will be sent to the OQ-Engine
    3.9.0
    * The plugin uses `numpy.load(allow_pickle=False)` while extracting data from the OQ-Engine
    3.8.0
    * Ruptures are loaded from OQ-Engine outputs as separate layers, one for each geometry type (polygon, line or point), instead of representing lines as degenerate flat polygons.
    * Ground motion fields are loaded from the OQ-Engine after pre-filtering them by event id, thus dramatically reducing data transfer and visualization time. This improvement made
      it possible to enable the visualization of ground motion fields also for event-based calculations.
    * Field data types of layers created from OQ-Engine outputs were fixed (they were wrongly all numeric before)
    * The list of calculation can be filtered by job id. This also makes possible to visualize old calculations that would not be listed among the most recent 100 calculations.
    * Ruptures are loaded through the OQ-Engine extract api, instead of exporting and loading the corresponding csv file.
    * Ruptures can be filtered by minimum magnitude, and a clear error message is displayed if no ruptures of such a high magnitude are found.
    * Whenever the plugin consolidates a memory layer into a file or copies a csv-based layer into an editable one, it produces a geopackage instead of a shapefile.
    * A section about the visualization of multi_risk OQ-Engine inputs and outputs has been added to the user manual.
    3.7.2
    * The management of profiles for the connection to the OpenQuake Platform was fixed.
    * The output type selector in the Data Viewer was disabled, so it still shows the output type but it can not be modified by the user.
    * OQ-Engine outputs to be loaded as tables from csv are loaded directly with a single click, instead of prior displaying a dialog showing the file size.
    * OQ-Engine outputs aggcurves for event_based_risk calculations can be visualized in the Data Viewer if experimental features of the plugin are enabled.
    * OQ-Engine input files can be downloaded as zip.
    * Added loader for OQ-Engine outputs 'agglosses'
    * The plugin is also a Processing Toolbox algorithm provider, offering an extensible set of field transformation functions
      (normalization/standardization, ranking, and others) and a modified version of the "Join attributes by location (summary)"
      algorithm, that automatically styles the output joined layer
    * Re-added and updated the user manual chapter about aggregating points by zone
    * Scripts running tests and building the user manual have been fixed
    * Layers loaded from OQ-Engine outputs store metadata (title and keywords) read from calculation parameters and user choices
    * The color for selected features is red for layers that use a cross symbol in the map (e.g. hazard curves and uniform hazard spectra)
    * Moving the mouse over recovery curves, a dynamic annotation is displayed, showing the coordinates of the pointed element
    * Widgets to select multiple items have been replaced by more compact selectors that also allow text searching
    * Selectors for tag values are added to the GUI, each containing a multiselector for values of a different tag
    * When a new OQ-Engine calculation is successfully launched, the corresponding row is highlighted in the list of calculations, and the list of its outputs is loaded
    * Moving the cursor through the list of available OQ-Engine calculations (using mouse or keystrokes), the calculation corresponding to the highlighted cell
      is automatically selected and its list of outputs is displayed
    3.7.1
    * Instead of the 'sourcegroups' output (that was removed from the OQ-Engine), the plugin can now load the new output 'events'
    * The user can choose if selecting the '.ini' file to run a OQ-Engine calculation, or letting the OQ-Engine automatically pick one from the list of input files.
    * A note about updating the SSL certificate bundle on MacOS was added to the manual
    * Buttons to load OQ-Engine outputs have been rearranged in order to keep the most significant ones to the left
    * Some additional information is available in exported csv files with recovery curves (recovery time approach, number of simulations, selected asset ids)
    * Fixed an error in managing integer values in QSettings using parameter type=int, that returned negative values (casting to int instead)
    3.7.0
    * Loading the OQ-Engine output 'dmg_by_asset', it is possible to aggregate assets by site (as in the previous implementation) or to load the raw data
      as it is compatible with the recovery modeling tool
    * The y-axis of recovery curves is displayed as a percentage instead of a number in the range 0-1
    * The recovery modeling tool calculates the probabilities of being in each damage state as the number of buildings per damage state divided by the total number of buildings (per asset)
    * While selecting assets for recovery modeling, a new checkbox enables/disables recalculating recovery curves on-the-fly
    * Another checkbox enables/disables the selection of all the assets that share the same coordinates, when the user clicks on a feature in the map
    3.6.1
    * Calls to QgsVectorLayer.getFeatures() are optimized, reading only the necessary fields and ignoring geometries if unneeded
    * Multi-peril input files containing geometries as WKT can be loaded as layers
    * Improvements to the integration tests: an instance of Irmt is used instead of instantiating Irmt sub-dialogs, and no mocked object is used anymore;
      OQ-Engine outputs that are loaded as QGIS layers are checked to contain at least one feature; an additional integration test runs a OQ-Engine hazard calculation,
      displays its progress log, then runs a risk calculation based on its outputs, showing again the progress, then deletes both calculations;
      instead of running one single big integration test, a single test is run for each OQ-Engine output type that the IRMT is able to load.
    * When the mouse points to the name of a OQ-Engine output, a tooltip displays the output type code and its approximate size (if available)
    * Fixed a useless downloading of unneeded files while loading OQ-Engine outputs using the "extract" API
    * Fixed the possibility to load data corresponding to specific taxonomies, for dmg_by_asset and losses_by_asset OQ-Engine output types
    3.6.0
    * Changed the realizations output for OQ-Engine scenario calculations, displaying the GSIM names instead of the branch path
    * All possibly running timers are stopped before the plugin is unloaded
    * Fixed a bug occurring while loading ground motion fields, that caused only one realization to be visualized
    3.5.3
    * The GUI elements for loading OQ-Engine outputs are in a scrollable area, usable also on low resolution screens
    * Some GUI sections can be expanded/collapsed
    3.5.2
    * Fixed a bug in the loader for asset_risk outputs, that was downloading a not used csv output
    3.5.1
    * Higher map values can optionally be rendered on top of lower values
    * The utility to import_layer_from_csv accepts two additional parameters: 'add_to_legend' and 'add_on_top'
    3.5.0
    * Layers imported from the OQ-Engine are inserted on top of the QGIS layer tree
    * Added loaders for OQ-Engine outputs 'asset_risk' and 'agg_risk'
    * The option to aggregate points by polygons is automatically enabled whenever at least one layer containing polygons becomes available
    * Geopackages containing polygons for the aggregation of points by zone can be pre-loaded, selecting the desired layers from the package
    * An additional checkbox gives the possibility to automatically discard zones that contain no points
    * Improved legends and classification criteria, depending on the unique values present in the field used for styling
    * The menu action to aggregate loss by zone was re-added, pointing to the Processing Toolkit algorithm that we use now to perform the 
      same kind of analysis (i.e. "Join attributes by location (summary)"). The section of the user manual that was previously removed is
      partially restored, and there is an explanation on how to use the Processing algorithm to obtain the same results that were obtained
      by the plugin tool before.
    * Fixed removal of plugin menu while the plugin is unloaded/uninstalled/disabled
    * Map units are not set by default anymore
    * Field names are quoted in order to avoid issues with special characters
    * Buttons to load layers that have no geometries are renamed from "Load layer" to "Load table"
    * Upgraded compatibility to the OQ Platform 2019
    * Better management of failing connection with the OQ Engine server
    * Fixed newline separators in csv files exported by the Data Viewer
    3.4.0
    * Whenever an error message is shown to the user, a button in the QGIS message bar allows to display the traceback in a separate window
    * Fixed loader for Aggregate Loss Curves in event based risk OQ-Engine output
    * Tests have been split into: unit tests (using the qgis.testing module); functional tests (running on the official QGIS docker
      without external services); integration tests (running on the official QGIS docker and interacting with a running OQ-Engine
    * When an OQ-Engine output can't be extracted, the error is handled and the full response message is logged
    3.3.0

    * It is possible to load hazard curves for a selected combination of realization/statistic and intensity measure type
    * Intensity measure levels are casted to float when possible, fixing a plotting issue in hazard curves with IMT=PGV
    * The cursor does not switch to "waiting" while refreshing the OQ-Engine calculation list
    * When feedback is shown outside the dialog that drives the OQ-Engine, a message suggests the user where to look
