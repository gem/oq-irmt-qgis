name=OpenQuake Integrated Risk Modelling Toolkit
qgisMinimumVersion=2.14
description=Tools to drive the OpenQuake Engine, to develop composite indicators and integrate them with physical risk estimations, and to predict building recovery times following an earthquake
about=This plugin allows users to drive OpenQuake Engine calculations (https://github.com/gem/oq-engine) of physical hazard and risk, and to load the corresponding outputs as QGIS layers. For those outputs, data visualization tools are provided. The toolkit also enables users to develop composite indicators to measure and quantify social characteristics, and combine them with estimates of human or infrastructure loss. The plugin can interact with the OpenQuake Platform (https://platform.openquake.org), to browse and download socio-economic data or existing projects, edit projects locally in QGIS and upload and share them with the scientific community. A post-earthquake recovery modeling framework is incorporated into the toolkit, to produce building level and/or community level recovery functions.

changelog=
    1.8.22
    * Added a sanity check on default colors stored in the settings, to make sure they are valid QColor objects
    * Added a checkbox to load from npz as layer only the selected items
    * Added a confirmation dialog to avoid removing oq-engine calculations by mistake
    * Added an error message in case a stored color setting is corrupted
    * The GUI displays the number of sites before loading a layer from NPZ
    1.8.21
    * Added tests for: importing hazard outputs from npz; selecting them with the Data Viewer; exporting selected data as csv.
    * Automatically add markers to uniform hazard spectra and hazard curves
    * Fixed management of possible connection errors while driving the OQ-Engine
    * Fixed layer selection issue in the recovery modeling dialog
    * Fixed a layout issue in the plugin's settings dialog (checkboxes correctly inserted in corresponding group boxes)
    * Fixed layout issues in the Data Viewer
    * Removed a duplication in the name assigned to layers imported from npz
    * Also csv-based layers with field names longer than 10 characters can now be used for recovery modeling
    1.8.20
    * Custom QGIS widgets for color selection were substituted with standard Qt widgets,
      improving compatibility with Windows and Mac OS X
    1.8.19
    * Fix adding features to layers when importing data from oq-engine outputs
    1.8.18
    * Redundancy reduced in the visualization of recovery curves
    * Fixed a numeric issue in saving shapefiles while having a locale that uses comma as decimal separator
    * The plugin keeps memory of the latest used directory
    * A new button enables to download the HDF5 datastore of a chosen OQ-Engine calculation
    * Minor improvements to the user manual
    * Some cleanup
    * Improved management of potential problems encountered while communicating with the OQ-Engine
    * Minor changes to the recovery modeling settings dialog
    * The automatic styling applied to layers after recalculating composite indices can be customized
      through the plugin's settings dialog (and it can be disabled)
    1.8.17
    * Losses from oq-engine are read from the single-file csv format
    * Improved manual with additional examples, instructions about installation and testing
    * Custom operators use an api that works both for QGIS 2.14ltr and 2.18
    * Continuous Integration on Jenkins and Travis
    * The plugin provides a clear error message in case a wrong output type is selected in the Data Viewer
    1.8.16
    * Additional reference to the CSSC project and to relevant scientific literature about recovery modeling
    * Improvements to the user manual, about OpenQuake outputs visualization
    * Updated description and about
    1.8.15
    * Improvements to the user manual: additional sections and screenshots about recovery
      modeling and driving the oq-engine server
    * Fix exception handling when the oq-engine server is not available
    * Enable scrolling in the Data Viewer
    * Additional tooltips added to explain the meaning of recovery modeling configuration variables
    * Check that each row of the transfer probabilities matrix sums to 1
    1.8.14
    * New settings dialog to edit recovery modeling parameters (removed config folder)
    * Settings for recovery modeling can be saved separately for each layer
    * Fixed a casting issue that caused a bug in the calculation of the overal time interval
    * Additional check on the rows of transfer probabilities: each one must sum to 1
    1.8.13
    * Many additions to the user manual
    * Messages displayed in the QGIS message bar are also added to the log
    * Fix header of csv for data exported from the Data Viewer
    * Improved visualization and export of uniform hazard spectra
    1.8.12
    * Fields containing damage states probabilities can be selected through a multiselect widget
    1.8.11
    * While calculating recovery curves, a feedback on the progress of the calculation is displayed
    * Changing the number of simulations per building does not cause the tool to immediately
      recalculate the recovery curve. Instead, an additional button can be used to launch the calculation
    * An additional checkbox enables/disables to save recovery curves for individual buildings
    1.8.10
    * Enable using a different number of loss-based damage states
    * When using a custom operator, children nodes will be displayed with equal diameter
    * Minor additions to the manual, describing the new nested menu
    * Do not time out when downloading an output from the OQ-Engine
    1.8.9
    * Allow API endpoints to be used with a self-signed SSL certificate
    1.8.8
    * Fix highlighting points on map when hovering on corresponding curves in plots
    * Fix visualization of multiple curves when switching IMT
    * Fix displaying the number of available event ids when loading ground motion fields from the OQ-Engine
    1.8.7
    * Remove all dependencies from the openquake libraries
    1.8.6
    * Use npz instead of hdf5
    * Fix displaying the output list for oq-engine calculations (properly refreshing)
    * Fix reading `composite_risk_model`, for plotting `dmg_total` and `dmg_by_taxon`
    1.8.5
    * Enable recovery modeling both for the csv output of oq-engine and for its shapefile translation
    1.8.4
    * Enable recalculating composite indices using custom operators
      with the same format used by the field calculator
    * Replace toolbox with a nested menu
    * Enable hdf5-related actions only on Ubuntu
    * While performing recovery modeling, enable changing the number of simulations per building
    * Add bugfixes and features introduced in stable versions of the plugin up to v1.7.16
