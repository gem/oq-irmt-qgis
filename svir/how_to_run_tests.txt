# to setup the testing environment:
source ../scripts/run-env-linux.sh /usr

# to run unit tests:
make unittest

# to run integration tests:
# you need a running engine server on localhost;
# the db should contain only the demos of the oq-engine:
# (cd oq-engine; activate the oq virtualenv; oq reset; ./bin/run-demos.sh demos);
# then:
make integrationtest

# to run integration tests for only one specific oq-engine calculation (e.g. 5):
SELECTED_CALC_ID=5 make integrationtest

# to run all tests:
make test
