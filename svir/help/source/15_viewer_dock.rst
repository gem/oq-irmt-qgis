********************
The IRMT Data Viewer
********************

The IRMT Data Viewer is a dock window added to QGIS by the IRMT plugin,
used for data visualization. It is shown/hidden by pressing the
button :guilabel:`Toggle IRMT Data Viewer`.

In its initial state, the window displays a :guilabel:`Output Type` selector,
that enables to trigger the visualization of different types of data, and
an initially empty plotting area.

The viewer can plot some of the outputs produced by the OpenQuake Engine,
such as hazard curves and uniform hazard spectra, and recovery curves (see
also :ref:`chap-definitions`).

When a layer containing compatible data is activated in the QGIS and the
corresponding output type is selected, the viewer is ready to visualize
the outputs corresponding to the features that will be selected in the map.

Plots are obtained using the *Matplotlib* library. Below the plotting area,
Matplotlib provides a toolbox with standard functionalities that enable
modifying markers, labels, axes, zooming level and other parameters, saving the
plot to file and exporting the selected curves into a csv format.


Visulalizing outputs of hazard calculations
===========================================

This section describes how to drive the user interface of the plugin to visualize
some of the hazard outputs produced by OpenQuake Engine calculations. For an extensive
explanation of those outputs, please refer to
the `user manual of the OpenQuake Engine <https://docs.openquake.org/oq-engine/stable/>`_.


Visualizing hazard curves
-------------------------

A hazard curve defines the relation between a scalar IML and the probability of
at least one exceedance of that IML within a time span T. The OpenQuake-engine
computes discrete hazard curves described by a two-dimensional array containing
a first column of n values of an IMT and a second column including values of
the probability of exceedance of the resultant IML in the time span T (which is
indicated in the OpenQuake-engine configuration file). A hazard curve is the
primary result of a PSHA analysis for a particular site. From hazard curves it
is possible to compute other result-typologies such as hazard maps and uniform
hazard spectra.

As described in :ref:`chap-drive-oq-engine`, the plugin enables to run
hazard calculations and to download the corresponding outputs. For outputs
of type `hcurves`, it is possible to load the data into a QGIS layer by
pressing the button :guilabel:`Load npz as layer`. The layer will contain,
for each point, the set of intensity measure levels and the corresponding
values of probability of exceedance, for each of the available intensity
measure types. While the layer is active, it is possible to select the
:guilabel:`Output Type` :guilabel:`Hazard Curves`, to activate the
visualization. When one or more points are selected in the map, the hazard
curves for the chosen :guilabel:`Intensity Measure Type` are plotted together
(:numref:`fig-dataViewerHazardCurves`). The legend also specifies the longitude
and latitude of the points corresponding to each of the curves in the plot. By
hovering on the legend items or on the curves, the corresponding points in the
map are highlighted.


.. warning:: The highlighting effect produced by hovering with the mouse on
   legend items or curves, stops working correctly when a layer is loaded using
   the OpenLayers Plugin. Please note that, starting from QGIS 2.18, base maps
   can be added as layers without installing any external plugin (such as
   OpenLayers), but using the new core functionality *XYZ driver* instead. In
   order to do so, you have to open the :guilabel:`Browser Panel`, right-click
   on the :guilabel:`Tile Server (XYZ)` and select :guilabel:`New
   connection...`.  Then, for instance, to add a connection to OpenStreetMap,
   you can insert into the text box the following string:
   `http://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`. Then press :guilabel:`Ok`
   and insert a name for the tile layer (e.g., *OpenStreetMap*). Afterwards, it
   is sufficient to double-click on the new item you have just created, to add
   OpenStreetMap to the :guilabel:`Layers Panel` and to visualize it in the map
   canvas.

Visualizing uniform hazard spectra
----------------------------------

A Uniform Hazard Spectrum (UHS) is a typology of result that is site-specific â€“
as in the case of hazard curves. A UHS defines a relationship between the
period (or frequency) of a period-dependent (or frequency-dependent) IMT such
as spectral acceleration and the resulting IMT value with a fixed probability
of exceedance in a time span T.

The workflow to visualize uniform hazard spectra is almost the same as the one
described above for visualizing hazard curves. In this case, the
:guilabel:`Output Type` to be loaded as layer is :guilabel:`Uniform Hazard
Spectra` (:numref:`fig-dataViewerUHS`).

Visualizing outputs of risk calculations
========================================

This section describes how to drive the user interface of the plugin to visualize
some of the risk outputs produced by OpenQuake Engine calculations. For an extensive
explanation of those outputs, please refer to
the `user manual of the OpenQuake Engine <https://docs.openquake.org/oq-engine/stable/>`_.


Visualizing aggregate loss curves
---------------------------------

Aggregate loss curves describe the exceedance probabilities for a set of loss
values for the entire portfolio of assets defined in the exposure model.

When the button :guilabel:`Show` is pressed, the Data Viewer is automatically
opened, providing a dropdown menu to select one of the available loss types,
and a tool to select multiple realizations or statistics. By default, the first
available loss type is pre-selected and all the realization or statistics are
displayed in the plot. Any change in these selections produces an automatic update
of the plot. The plot shows in abscissa the return period (in years) and in
ordinate the aggregate loss (the measurement unit depends on the parameters of
the OQ-Engine calculation).


Visualizing aggregate damage by asset
-------------------------------------

.. FIXME scientific description

When the button :guilabel:`Aggregate` is pressed, the Data Viewer is automatically
opened, providing a dropdown menu to select one of the available realizations, and
another one to select one of the available loss types. Two widgets enable the
selection of multiple tag names and, for each tag, one or more of its values.
The additional checkbox :guilabel:`Exclude "no damage"` is checked by default,
excluding from the plot the damage "no damage" state, which in most cases is
predominant with respect to the others and therefore the corresponding bar would
look too high in proportion with the others.
The bar plot shows the damage distribution, where each bar corresponds to one of the
damage states, and the height of the bar corresponds to the number of asset in that
damage state. If no filter is selected, the whole damage distribution is displayed.
If something is selected, a text field lists the selected tags, each with the chosen value.
If a tag is selected, but no corresponding value is chosen, the filter will not be applied.


Visualizing aggregate losses by asset
-------------------------------------

.. FIXME scientific description

When the button :guilabel:`Aggregate` is pressed, the Data Viewer is automatically
opened, providing a dropdown menu to select one of the available loss types. Two widgets
enable the selection of multiple tag names and, for each tag, one or more of its values.
If the value :guilabel:`*` is chosen, aggregate losses for each value are reported.
The results are presented as a table containing, for each tag and for each realization,
the corresponding aggregate loss.
If no filter is selected, the total losses for each realization are displayed.
If something is selected, a text field lists the selected tags, each with the chosen value.
If a tag is selected, but no corresponding value is chosen, the filter will not be applied.


Visualizing recovery curves
===========================

    IRMT Data Viewer used for recovery modeling analysis

Please refer to :ref:`chap-recovery-modeling` for a general overview of
the recovery modeling workflow, its scientific background and the description
of the parameters and of the configuration files.

When one point is selected in the map, the corresponding building-level
recovery curve is plotted. By selecting two or more points, the
corresponding community-level recovery curve is displayed.

The selection can be made by clicking points directly in the map, or by
leveraging other selection tools available in QGIS. For instance, it
might be useful to select buildings that share a specific taxonomy.
In order to do so, it is sufficient to click the
:guilabel:`Select features using an expression` button in the QGIS
toolbar, and to use the expression editor to perform the desired query.
A useful example could be an expression such as:
`"taxonomy" LIKE 'LC-%'`, that would select all those features for which
the `taxonomy` field begins with the string `"LC-"`, i.e., all "low
building code" assets.
