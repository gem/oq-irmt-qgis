*****************
The plugin's menu
*****************

When the IRMT plugin is installed, it adds its own menu to those available
on the QGIS graphical user interface. The plugin's menu contains the
options listed below. For each option, this manual provides a separate chapter
with the description of its functionality and of the typical workflow in which
it is used. Please follow the links next to the option icons, to reach the
corresponding documentation.

.. note::

    The menu's options are disabled when the corresponding
    functionalities can not be performed. For instance, the
    *Transform attributes* option will be available only as long as
    one of the loaded layers is activated.
