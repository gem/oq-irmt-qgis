# QGIS plugin to drive the OpenQuake Engine, to develop Social Vulnerability and Integrated Risk composite indices, and to predict building recovery times following an earthquake

This QGIS plugin allows users to drive [OpenQuake Engine](https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/)
calculations of physical hazard and risk, and to load the corresponding outputs
as QGIS layers. Those outputs are automatically styled and can be further explored
through interactive data visualization tools that are provided by the plugin.

The toolkit also enables users to develop composite indicators to
measure and quantify social characteristics, and to combine them with estimates of
human or infrastructure loss. The users can directly interact with the
[OpenQuake Platform](https://platform.openquake.org/), in order to
browse and download socioeconomic data or existing projects, to edit
projects locally in QGIS, then to upload and share them through the Platform.

A post-earthquake recovery modeling framework is incorporated into the toolkit,
to produce building level and/or community level recovery functions, that
predict recovery times following an earthquake.

This plugin has been created by the [GEM Foundation](http://www.globalquakemodel.org/gem/).
