# QGIS plugin for Social Vulnerability and Integrated Risk (SVIR)

Tools for creating and editing indicators and composite indices and for combining
these with estimates of physical earthquake risk (i.e. estimates of human or
infrastructure loss).

The plugin enables users to directly interact with the
[OpenQuake Platform](https://platform.openquake.org/), in order to
browse and download socioeconomic data or existing projects, to edit
projects locally in QGIS, then to
upload and share them through the Platform.

This plugin has been created by the [GEM Foundation](http://www.globalquakemodel.org/gem/).
