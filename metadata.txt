    1.6.0
    New features:
    * Composite indices calculations refactored and unified
    * Tests implemented for all operators on single node calculations
    * Tests implemented for multiple composite variables calculations
    * Bidirectional updating of project definitions between python and javascript
    * Socioeconomic themes saved into additional fields in the layer (allowing to style the layer accordingly)
    * Render non-computable nodes and corresponding links as semi-transparent
    * New "geometric mean" operator
    * Primary indicators' labels rendered on the right of the D3 tree to avoid overlapping
    * When downloading a layer from the OQ-Platform, get the "supplemental information" leveraging the ad-hoc API
    * More readable project's details while browsing OQ-Platform's layers
    * In the project manager it is possible to make a copy of the currently selected project definition
