description=Tools for the development of composite indicators measuring societal characteristics and the integration of these with physical risk estimations
about=<p>Tools for creating and editing indicators and composite indices to measure social characteristics and for combining these with estimates of physical earthquake risk (i.e. estimates of human or infrastructure loss).</p><p>The plugin enables users to directly interact with the <a href='https://platform.openquake.org'>OpenQuake Platform</a>, in order to browse and download socioeconomic data or existing projects, to edit projects locally in QGIS, then to upload and share them through the Platform.</p><p>This plugin was designed as a collaborative effort between the <a href='http://www.globalquakemodel.org'>GEM Foundation</a> and the <a href='http://www.cedim.de/english/'>Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology</a>, and it has been developed by the GEM Foundation.

changelog=
    1.6.2
    Small fixes:
    * When aggregating loss by zone, let sum and average be NULL instead of 0 for zones containing no loss points
    * Fix issue in node's circles rendering in case an 'ignoring weights' operator is selected
    * Style and render the layer immediately, selecting one of its fields through the weighting dialog
    * Fix a corner case in field transformations, updating project definitions only when available
    1.6.1
    Small fixes:
    * Improved editing of an indicator's name in the weighting dialog
    * Weighting dialog's elements expand correctly on window resize
    * Minor improvements to the multiselect widget
    1.6.0
    New features:
    * More intuitive way to delete nodes (right-click instead of long-press)
    * Possibility to transform multiple fields at once
    * Fixed issue with CSV import in QGIS 2.10
    * Possibility to overwrite transformed fields or to set project definitions to track a transformed field
    * Node names can now be changed also through the weighting dialog
    * Composite indices calculations refactored and unified
    * Tests implemented for all operators on single node calculations
    * Tests implemented for multiple composite variables calculations
    * Bidirectional updating of project definitions between python and javascript
    * Socioeconomic themes saved into additional fields in the layer (allowing to style the layer accordingly)
    * Render non-computable nodes and corresponding links as semi-transparent
    * New "geometric mean" operator
    * Primary indicators' labels rendered on the right of the D3 tree to avoid overlapping
    * When downloading a layer from the OQ-Platform, get the "supplemental information" leveraging the ad-hoc API
    * More readable project's details while browsing OQ-Platform's layers
    * From the weighting dialog it is possible to select the field to be used to style the layer
    * In the project manager it is possible to make a copy of the currently selected project definition
